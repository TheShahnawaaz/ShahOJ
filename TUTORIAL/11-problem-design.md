# Problem Design Guidelines

Creating high-quality competitive programming problems requires careful consideration of difficulty, clarity, and educational value. This guide covers best practices for designing engaging and well-balanced problems.

## üéØ Problem Design Principles

### 1. Clear Problem Statement
- **Unambiguous**: Every aspect should have exactly one interpretation
- **Complete**: All necessary information provided, nothing extra
- **Engaging**: Interesting context that motivates the problem
- **Accessible**: Understandable by the target audience

### 2. Appropriate Difficulty
- **Progressive**: Build complexity gradually
- **Fair**: Solvable with intended algorithms/techniques
- **Discriminating**: Separates different skill levels effectively
- **Educational**: Teaches valuable concepts or techniques

### 3. Robust Testing
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all edge cases and patterns
- **Stress Testing**: Validates performance under maximum constraints
- **Multiple Solutions**: Accepts all correct approaches
- **Clear Verdicts**: Unambiguous pass/fail criteria

## üèóÔ∏è Problem Structure Design

### 1. Input/Output Format Design

#### Good Format Design:
```
Input:
- First line: n (number of elements)
- Second line: n space-separated integers

Output:
- Single integer (the answer)
```

#### Avoid Complex Formats:
```
‚ùå Bad: Mixed input types without clear structure
Input:
- First line: n, then k, then m
- Next n lines: each with variable number of integers
- Then some strings
- Then more numbers...

‚úÖ Good: Clear, consistent structure
Input:
- First line: n, k, m
- Next n lines: each with exactly k integers
- Next m lines: each with a string of length ‚â§ 100
```

### 2. Constraint Design

#### Meaningful Constraints:
```python
# Design constraints that allow intended solutions
def design_constraints():
    # For O(n¬≤) solution
    if intended_complexity == "O(n¬≤)":
        max_n = 5000  # 5000¬≤ = 25M operations ‚âà 1 second
    
    # For O(n log n) solution
    elif intended_complexity == "O(n log n)":
        max_n = 200000  # 200K * log(200K) ‚âà 3.6M operations
    
    # For O(n) solution
    elif intended_complexity == "O(n)":
        max_n = 1000000  # 1M operations
    
    return max_n
```

#### Constraint Relationships:
```yaml
# Ensure constraints make sense together
constraints:
  n: [1, 100000]          # Array size
  values: [-10^9, 10^9]   # Element values
  sum_bound: 10^15        # Maximum possible sum (n * max_value)
  queries: [1, 100000]    # Number of queries
  time_limit: 2000        # 2 seconds (higher for complex problems)
```

### 3. Test Case Design Strategy

#### Systematic Test Coverage:
```python
def design_test_cases():
    test_plan = {
        # Basic functionality
        "samples": [
            "simple_example",
            "edge_case_example", 
            "typical_case_example"
        ],
        
        # Edge cases
        "edge_cases": [
            "minimum_constraints",  # n=1, smallest values
            "maximum_constraints",  # n=max, largest values
            "boundary_values",      # values at constraint boundaries
            "empty_or_trivial"      # special cases
        ],
        
        # Algorithmic patterns
        "patterns": [
            "worst_case_for_naive",     # Exposes O(n¬≤) solutions
            "best_case_scenario",       # Everything works optimally
            "average_case",             # Typical random input
            "adversarial_case"          # Designed to break solutions
        ],
        
        # Stress tests
        "stress": [
            "maximum_size",             # Largest possible input
            "maximum_operations",       # Most work required
            "memory_intensive",         # Tests memory limits
            "time_intensive"            # Tests time limits

## üéØ Advanced Design Techniques

### 1. Multi-Phase Problems

```python
def multi_phase_problem():
    """
    Example: Social Network Analysis
    Phase 1: Graph construction and validation
    Phase 2: Community detection (Union-Find)
    Phase 3: Influence calculation (BFS/DFS)
    Phase 4: Optimization (Greedy/DP)
    """
    
    phases = [
        {"technique": "graph_theory", "difficulty": "medium"},
        {"technique": "union_find", "difficulty": "medium"},
        {"technique": "graph_traversal", "difficulty": "easy"},
        {"technique": "optimization", "difficulty": "hard"}
    ]
    
    return phases
```

### 2. Interactive Problems

Design problems with real-time interaction:

```python
def interactive_problem_design():
    return {
        "query_limit": 20,  # Reasonable number of queries
        "query_types": ["guess", "range_query", "update"],
        "feedback": "immediate",
        "termination": "correct_answer_or_query_limit",
        "scoring": "based_on_queries_used"
    }
```

### 3. Approximation Problems

Design problems where exact solutions are hard but approximations are acceptable:

```python
def approximation_problem():
    return {
        "exact_solution": "NP-hard or very complex",
        "approximation_ratio": "within 10% of optimal",
        "scoring": "based_on_solution_quality",
        "multiple_approaches": "greedy, local_search, heuristics"
    }
```

## üìà Problem Evolution and Refinement

```python
def problem_refinement_cycle():
    stages = [
        "initial_design",
        "prototype_implementation", 
        "test_case_generation",
        "solution_validation",
        "difficulty_calibration",
        "statement_refinement",
        "final_testing"
    ]
    
    for stage in stages:
        print(f"Stage: {stage}")
        feedback = collect_feedback(stage)
        improvements = identify_improvements(feedback)
        apply_improvements(improvements)
    
    return "refined_problem"
```

### 2. Difficulty Calibration

```python
def calibrate_difficulty():
    """
    Test problem with solutions of varying quality
    """
    
    test_solutions = [
        {"type": "optimal", "expected": "AC"},
        {"type": "suboptimal_but_correct", "expected": "AC"},
        {"type": "too_slow", "expected": "TLE"},
        {"type": "wrong_algorithm", "expected": "WA"},
        {"type": "edge_case_miss", "expected": "WA"}
    ]
    
    for solution in test_solutions:
        result = test_solution(solution)
        if result != solution["expected"]:
            adjust_constraints_or_tests()
```

### 3. Community Feedback Integration
